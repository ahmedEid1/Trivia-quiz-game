## Required Tasks

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

## Request Formatting

You'll primarily work within the ```components``` folder in order to edit the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses. 

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to and update the frontend to make request and handle responses appropriately: 
- Correct endpoints
- Update response body handling
